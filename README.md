# Computational-Model-for-Predictive-Diagnosis-of-Thyroid-Cancer
Thyroid cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors in the endocrine system and has seen a growing number of diagnoses worldwide. Early detection is essential for improving patient outcomes, increasing treatment success rates, and reducing the need for invasive procedures.

In this context, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as powerful tools, integrating artificial intelligence and medical image analysis to assist physicians in exam interpretation and decision-making. A crucial aspect of these deep learning models is the choice of activation functions, which introduce non-linearity into neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns in medical images. Since activation functions directly influence a modelâ€™s learning and generalization capabilities, understanding their characteristics and exploring new approaches is essential for optimizing performance.

This study presents a comparative analysis of different activation functions applied to thyroid cancer diagnosis using ultrasound images and the Vision Transformer (ViT) Hybrid model. This architecture leverages the feature extraction power of Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet50) while integrating Vision Transformers' global attention mechanisms. Among the evaluated functions, the Mexican Hat wavelet, known for its sharp peaks that enhance pattern and edge detection, was explored as an activation function in this complex problem.

Our findings highlight the Mexican Hat wavelet as the best-performing function in terms of Balanced Accuracy (68.39%) and F1-Score (80%) within the ViT Hybrid model. Additionally, it demonstrated superior performance compared to other activation functions when applied to ResNet50 alone. However, the study also reveals that dataset imbalance and limited data availability led to signs of overfitting during training.

Despite these challenges, our results emphasize the crucial role of activation function selection in medical AI applications, as improved model performance translates to more accurate and reliable diagnoses.
